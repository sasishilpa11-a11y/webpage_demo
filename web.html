    <p>A Finite Automaton (FA) is a simple mathematical model of computation that recognizes regular languages.
It consists of a finite number of states and transitions between them based on input symbols.
An FA reads the input string symbol by symbol and accepts or rejects it depending on the final state reached.

There are two main types:

Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)

Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)</p>
